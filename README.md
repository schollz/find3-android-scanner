# find3 android app

This is the open-source minimal Android app for using with [FIND3](https://github.com/schollz/find3). This app will allow you to use your phone to 
perform constant scans of Bluetooth and WiFi signals and levels that can be associated with certain locations in your home to allow internal positioning.

To get started with this app, use Android Studio 3+ and "Import Project" after downloading the Git repository.

# Roadmap

- [x] Get locations for a family after it is typed in, and use those for autocompletion.
